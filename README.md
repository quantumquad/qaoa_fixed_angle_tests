# QED-C Tests of the QAOA Fixed Angle Conjecture

This repository contains the simplest possible code that executes the same QAOA algorithm used in the QED-C Max-Cut benchmark.  
This example code is designed to highlight the disrepancy between the results obtained with this QAOA implementation and the results presented in the Fixed Angle Conjecture paper.
